MERN:
-----
  It stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js.

User Authentication:
-------------------
  Making sure user is logging-in with correct credentials.

JWT:
----
  JsonWebToken is used for user authorisation and privileges
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbsmsi7l3r4&t=608s

  Generate secret key:
  -------------------
    $ node
    > require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex');

  How JWT works:
  -------------
    0.1) User signs-in and credentials are stored in database after encrypting
       the password using 'bcrypt' module in Express.
    0.2) User logs-in and user credentials are 'authenticated' from Database.
    1) Using JWT, a token is created with privileges and other details attached
       to it and encrypted for security.
       Ex: jwt.sign();
    2) This token is sent to user after login was successful. This must be
       stored as cookies , in localStorage or state variable.
    3) Token must be sent to the server in order to access protected pages.
      3.1) Token can be sent through fetch (not recommended).
      3.2) In React, create a 'state' variable to store token which send the 
           token to server for each page which are protected.
    4) Using middleware function, which is created by the developer and does not
       come with the JWT module, the token is decrypted for authorisation.
